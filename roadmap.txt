-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL FUTURE STUFF TO LOOK INTO

- make separete repo containing custom models to be used optionally with rando
    for songs, capacity upgrades, and even custom items

- fix sunken heart pieces
    needs asm to make heart pieces ignore inventory
    then all heart pieces will be changed back into heart piece actors

- randomize seashells
    will be by far the most complex asm
    seashells need to ignore inventory as well as add actor params to the ones dynamically spawned in

- turn small key actors that are not actually keys into golden leaf actors to remove compass ringing
    needs asm patch to make golden leaf actors ignore inventory

- fix dampe logic for instrument shuffle
    logic currently assumes that if you have the instrument, you have all the items needed to clear the rooms
    this is obviously not true with instrument shuffle, but logic is complex and I do not care enough for it


    FIXED, NEEDS TESTING
fix fishing bottle (tried sneakily adding and removing the bottle from inventory, but Inventory.RemoveItem cannot handle indexes)
    wrote asm to make Inventory.RemoveItem itemType 0 remove the bottle, since nothing uses the event to remove SwordLv1
    this need testing because the game could potentially reference the same function for Dampe

fix ball and chain soldier not spawning if the player has the leaf (likely needs asm patches)
    wrote asm to skip over deleting the enemy if the player has the leaf
