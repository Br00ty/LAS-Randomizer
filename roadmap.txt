v0.4

- make sure logic knows that you can't have both followers at once

- merge settings from ProfessorLaw's fork

----------
v0.5

- eventflow edits through code gets pretty messy and hard to follow
    create our own type of flowchart file and write a parser that'll translate them into the .bfevfl files
    im a lot more confident to write this after the .asm parser :>

- barren dungeons

- work on custom text and finish keysanity implementation
    use custom text to make tunics more intuitive
    we can use the new FlowControl::CompareInt to determine what text to display for keysanity

----------
v0.6

- shuffle followers
    rooster implementation is easy, just need to compile a list of every room + the actor of the check
    bowwow has not been tested. Unlike the rooster, bowwow physically exists and needs to be touched
    if nothing works too well, we can always use custom text and require to go to a telephone booth

- shop
    needs ASM changes to set the gettingFlag of the stolen item
    once set, we can simply just check for the flags in the post steal eventflow

----------
v0.7

- trendy
    needs .bfres editing, at least enough to rename the model & file

- randomized trendy physics

----------
GENERAL FUTURE STUFF TO LOOK INTO

- make custom Randomizer.bfevfl file to for every other flowchart to subflow to
    this way, we don't need to add all the different event actors to every single flowchart we edit
    subflow also allows passing parameters such as the item index
    this will give a cleaner result to debug since any bugged item event will just be in 1 location

- make every telephone booth have bowwow and rooster to swap between

- individual tricks toggles

- better workaround for slime key

- make separete repo containing custom models to be used optionally with rando
    for songs, capacity upgrades, and even custom items

- fix sunken heart pieces
    needs asm to make heart pieces ignore inventory
    then all heart pieces will be changed back into heart piece actors

- randomize seashells
    FINISH PARTIAL SEASHELL SUPPORT
    will be by far the most complex asm
    seashells need to ignore inventory as well as add actor params to the ones dynamically spawned in

- turn small key actors that are not actually keys into golden leaf actors to remove compass ringing
    needs asm patch to make golden leaf actors ignore inventory

- fix dampe logic for instrument shuffle
    logic currently assumes that if you have the instrument, you have all the items needed to clear the rooms
    this is obviously not true with instrument shuffle, but logic is complex and I do not care enough for it
