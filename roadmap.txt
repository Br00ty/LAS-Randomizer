v0.3

test logic updater and custom logic

make sure to set the GetMagicPowder flag if the player got it from Dampe
    and also just give Dampe some time in general to fix things up lol

any potential GUI cleanup

MAYBE look into text editing to make slime key not so confusing

make a release candidate build, give it a few weeks

probably release the randomizer on gamebanana when it is considered fully stable

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4

trendy

shop

individual tricks toggles

make separete repo containing custom models to be used optionally with rando
    for songs, capacity upgrades, and even custom items

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL FUTURE STUFF TO LOOK INTO

fix sunken heart pieces (likely needs asm patches)

randomize seashells (needs asm patches)

turn small key actors into golden leaf actors to remove compass ringing (needs asm patches)

fix dampe logic for instrument shuffle sometime (i refuse to do this myself lol)

fix fishing bottle (tried sneakily adding and removing the bottle from inventory, but Inventory.RemoveItem cannot handle indexes)

fix ball and chain soldier not spawning if the player has the leaf (likely needs asm patches)
