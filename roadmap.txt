v0.4

BUGS

- chests and seashell mansion do not set the flag for Bottle[1], making Fishing Pond take it away

    no idea yet if the unused FlowControl.CompareInt(value1, value2) event works to compare indexes
    it's probably easier to use $FishingBottle or something for chests to go to an EntryPoint

    seashell mansion we don't really need to be doing this huge itemKey comparison
    we can just subflow to EntryPoint itemKey

- potential of kanalet crow to not drop the "leaf" if you have the actual leaf

    this is strange because the leaf is turned into a SmallKey actor
    the crow does have "1" as a parameter however, maybe this is why
    relook into the other Kanalet checks and make sure they all work even when you have all 5 leaves


FEATURES

- eventflow edits through code gets pretty messy and hard to follow
    create our own type of flowchart file and write a parser that'll translate them into the .bfevfl files

- work on custom text and finish keysanity implementation

- make custom give_item.bfevfl file to for every other flowchart to subflow to
    this way, we don't need to add all the event actors to every single flowchart we edit
    subflow also allows passing parameters such as the item index
    this will give a cleaner result to debug since any bugged item event will just be in 1 location

- write custom text for tunics, also make telephone tunic switcher less confusing

- shuffle followers
    rooster implementation is easy, just need to compile a list of every room + the actor of the check
    bowwow has not been tested. Unlike the rooster, bowwow physically exists and needs to be touched
    if nothing works too well, we can always use custom text and require to go to a telephone booth

- make every telephone booth have bowwow and rooster to swap between

- make sure logic knows that you can't have both followers at once


----------
v0.5

- trendy
    most likely needs .bfres editing, will need to look into again

- shop
    needs ASM changes to make the gettingFlag of the stolen item get set
    once set, we can simply just check for the flags in the post steal eventflow


----------
GENERAL FUTURE STUFF TO LOOK INTO

- individual tricks toggles

- better workaround for slime key

- make separete repo containing custom models to be used optionally with rando
    for songs, capacity upgrades, and even custom items

- fix sunken heart pieces
    needs asm to make heart pieces ignore inventory
    then all heart pieces will be changed back into heart piece actors

- randomize seashells
    will be by far the most complex asm
    seashells need to ignore inventory as well as add actor params to the ones dynamically spawned in

- turn small key actors that are not actually keys into golden leaf actors to remove compass ringing
    needs asm patch to make golden leaf actors ignore inventory

- fix dampe logic for instrument shuffle
    logic currently assumes that if you have the instrument, you have all the items needed to clear the rooms
    this is obviously not true with instrument shuffle, but logic is complex and I do not care enough for it
