THIS IS JUST A CONCEPT CURRENTLY, NO PARSER CODE HAS BEEN WRITTEN YET

As such, the format is likely to undergo some changes

If this is in the main branch, I forgot to remove this lol


These will now be yaml documents because it will be much easier to parse than some random custom pseudocode
May be a bit messier than I intended, but still easier to read than through code :)
